I developed this software as a Christmas gift for my mother, a non-native English speaker who has struggled with expressing herself effectively in a language that is not her first. This has been a significant barrier for her in her professional endeavors as a business owner.

The goal of this web app to help my mother write clear and concise emails with confidence. It offers a high-quality translation tool built on GPT-3 that is specifically designed for writing emails, as well as advanced features such as context-aware translation.

Give this simple first iteration a try!: https://jingxiangmo-email-secretary-app-m8fgfa.streamlit.app/
